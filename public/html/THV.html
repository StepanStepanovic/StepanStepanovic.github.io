          I conceptualized and developed the practical lectures with the guidance and support of the professor responsible for the subject. These lectures are tailored for students with a light math background and are designed to introduce key concepts, including linear algebra in the first two lectures, assuming no prior knowledge of matrices. The text contains typos and even some fundamental errors, as it was conceptualized and typed in a hurry, and I have not yet reviewed it. When time permits, I plan to translate all the lectures into English to make them more accessible. Currently, the documents are intended to serve as initial drafts.   Examn examples, based on these lectures, are also provided.   <br>
